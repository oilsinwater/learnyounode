The solution is broken down into several lines for the sake of readability, 
but we can cram the solution into a single line if we want to.  However, 
this formatting may cause some to become nauseated, enraged, or both.  
Use at your own risk.

In my solution, I am getting the number of lines in my file with the
getLines() function.  The getLines() function can receive a callback 
as an argument.  Below, I am declaring two more functions called logLines()
and magicNumber().  The logLines() function prints the number of lines in my
file to the console, and the magicNumber() function allows me to pass a magic
number as the fourth argument in the command line.  If my file has as many
lines or more than my magic number, it tells me me that it has more as many
or more lines.  If not, the function says my file does not have as many
or more lines
